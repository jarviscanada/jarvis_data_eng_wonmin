# Introduction


# Quick Start
- Prequiresites: Docker, CentOS 7
- Docker scritps with description
	- build images
  - create docker network
  - start containers

# Architecture
- Draw a component diagram which contains controllers, services, DAOs, psql, IEX Cloud, WebServlet/Tomcat, HTTP client, and SpringBoot. 
- briefly explain the following components and services (3-5 sentences for each)
  - Controller layer (e.g. handles user requests....)
  - Service layer
  - DAO layer
  - SpringBoot: webservlet/TomCat and IoC

## Quote Controller
- High-level description for this controller. Where is market data coming from (IEX) and how did you cache the quote data (PSQL). Briefly talk about data from within your app

- briefly explain each endpoint
## App controller

## Optional(Dashboard controller)
- High-level description for this controller.
- briefly explain each endpoint

# Docker Deployment
- docker diagram including images, containers, network, and docker hub
e.g. https://www.notion.so/jarviscanada/Dockerize-Trading-App-fc8c8f4167ad46089099fd0d31e3855d#6f8912f9438e4e61b91fe57f8ef896e0
